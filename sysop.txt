I) About SyncWOTD

A Word of the Day external program (door) written in javascript for Synchronet 
BBS and data provided by Wordnik Online Dictionary (https://www.wordnik.com/).

The call to the API requires an API Key, which can be obtained for free, just 
follow the steps in their FAQ(http://developer.wordnik.com/#!/faq). More 
details are listed below (II).

Help with getting the date into the yyyy-mm-dd format without being able to use 
functions like Date.getFullYear was provided by Date Format 1.2.3, found 
[here](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format).

--------------------

II) Getting a Wordnik API Key

The place to start is with http://developer.wordnik.com/#!/faq

It will first direct you to this page to sign up for a free Wordnik account:
http://www.wordnik.com/signup
Go through the sign up process. 

Once you have that set up, it directs you to this page to request a key:
http://developer.wordnik.com/
Fill out the form as directed. Feel free to link to the public Github page for
this project (https://github.com/KenDB3/SyncWOTD/). 

You should receive an email with your API Key, but then again, you may not. 
I did not receive my email, but when I checked my profile page 2 days later
the API key was there at the bottom, so try these instructions before 
reaching out to Wordnik for help:

1) Log in to Wordnik at https://www.wordnik.com/
   If you have trouble with that site, try this http://www.wordnik.com/
2) Go to this page: https://www.wordnik.com/users/edit
   Scroll to the bottom and you will find a section labeled: 
   "Your Wordnik API key"
3) You can now use this for section III, part B.

If you do not find your API Key there, then you should head over to this link:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/wordnik-api/JBhk2ob8fwk
This is a thread on the Wordnik forum for folks that had trouble getting the 
API Key 

--------------------

III) External Program Configuration

A) If you downloaded this as a ZIP file, extract the files to a folder in your
   /sbbs/xtrn/ directory. This doc assumes you named the folder "SyncWOTD" 
   (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/SyncWOTD/). 
   
   Primary Files Required for the App to Run:
   ctrl-a_colors.js
   dateFormat.js
   wotd.js

B) Add the following section to your ctrl/modopts.ini file (typically located 
   at /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini):

[SyncWOTD]
wordnikAPIkey = <your API key here>

Change the entry for "wordnikAPIkey = <your API key here>" by adding your API 
Key from Section II. 
	Example:
wordnikAPIkey = 123456789abc1234

C) Set up the External Door via Synchornet Configuration, External Programs

17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
18: Time Options...

NOTE: If you want it to also be used as a Logon Event, you can change #14, 
"Execute on Event", accordingly. 
Example:
14: Execute on Event           Logon
Which makes it a door you can run from Externals as well as a Logon Event
or...
14: Execute on Event           Logon, Only
Which makes it Only a Logon Event
