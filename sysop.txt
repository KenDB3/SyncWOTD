I) About SyncWOTD

A Word of the Day external program (door) written in javascript for Synchronet 
BBS and data provided by Wordnik Online Dictionary (https://www.wordnik.com/).

The call to the API requires an API Key, which can be obtained for free, just 
follow the steps in their FAQ(http://developer.wordnik.com/#!/faq). More 
details are listed below (II).

Help with getting the date into the yyyy-mm-dd format without being able to use functions like Date.getFullYear was provided by Date Format 1.2.3, found [here](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format).

II) Getting a Wordnik API Key

The place to start is with http://developer.wordnik.com/#!/faq

It will first direct you to this page to sign up for a free Wordnik account:

Once you have that set up, it directs you to this page to request a key:

III) External Program Configuration

A) If you downloaded this as a ZIP file, extract the files to a folder in your
   /sbbs/xtrn/ directory. This doc assumes you named the folder "SyncWOTD" 
   (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/SyncWOTD/). 
   
   Primary Files Required for the App to Run:
   ctrl-a_colors.js
   dateFormat.js
   wotd.js

B) Add the following section to your ctrl/modopts.ini file (typically located 
   at /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini):

[SyncWOTD]
wordnikAPIkey = <your API key here>

Change the entry for "wordnikAPIkey = <your API key here>" by adding your API 
Key from Section II. 
	Example:
wordnikAPIkey = 123456789abc1234
